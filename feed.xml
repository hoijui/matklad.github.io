    </h1>
<p><span>A short note on two related rules of thumb.</span></p>
<section id="Push-Ifs-Up">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Push-Ifs-Up"><span>Push Ifs Up</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>If there</span>&rsquo;<span>s an </span><code>if</code><span> condition inside a function, consider if it could be moved to the caller instead:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-comment">// GOOD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">frobnicate</span>(walrus: Walrus) {</span>
<span class="line">    ...</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-comment">// BAD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">frobnicate</span>(walrus: <span class="hl-type">Option</span>&lt;Walrus&gt;) {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">let</span> <span class="hl-variable">walrus</span> = <span class="hl-keyword">match</span> walrus {</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">Some</span>(it) =&gt; it,</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-literal">None</span> =&gt; <span class="hl-keyword">return</span>,</span>
<span class="line">  };</span>
<span class="line">  ...</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>As in the example above, this often comes up with preconditions: a function might check precondition</span>
<span>inside and </span>&ldquo;<span>do nothing</span>&rdquo;<span> if it doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t hold, or it could push the task of precondition checking to</span>
<span>its caller, and enforce via types (or an assert) that the precondition holds. With preconditions</span>
<span>especially, </span>&ldquo;<span>pushing up</span>&rdquo;<span> can become viral, and result in fewer checks overall, which is one</span>
<span>motivation for this rule of thumb.</span></p>
<p><span>Another motivation is that control flow and </span><code>if</code><span>s are complicated, and are  a source of bugs. By</span>
<span>pushing </span><code>if</code><span>s up, you often end up centralizing control flow in a single function, which has a</span>
<span>complex branching logic, but all the actual work is delegated to straight line subroutines.</span></p>
<p><em><span>If</span></em><span> you have complex control flow, better to fit it on a screen in a single function, rather than</span>
<span>spread throughout the file. What</span>&rsquo;<span>s more, with all the flow in one place it often is possible to</span>
<span>notice redundancies and dead conditions. Compare:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">f</span>() {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> foo &amp;&amp; bar {</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> foo {</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">    } <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">    }</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">g</span>() {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> foo &amp;&amp; bar {</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">h</span>()</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">h</span>() {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> foo {</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">  } <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>For </span><code>f</code><span>, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s much easier to notice a dead branch than for a combination of </span><code>g</code><span> and </span><code>h</code><span>!</span></p>
<p><span>A related pattern here is what I call </span>&ldquo;<span>dissolving enum</span>&rdquo;<span> refactor. Sometimes, the code ends up</span>
<span>looking like this:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">enum</span> <span class="hl-title class_">E</span> {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">Foo</span>(<span class="hl-type">i32</span>),</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">Bar</span>(<span class="hl-type">String</span>),</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">main</span>() {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">let</span> <span class="hl-variable">e</span> = <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">f</span>();</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">g</span>(e)</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">f</span>() <span class="hl-punctuation">-&gt;</span> E {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> condition {</span>
<span class="line">    E::<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">Foo</span>(x)</span>
<span class="line">  } <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line">    E::<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">Bar</span>(y)</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">g</span>(e: E) {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">match</span> e {</span>
<span class="line">    E::<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">Foo</span>(x) =&gt; <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">foo</span>(x),</span>
<span class="line">    E::<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">Bar</span>(y) =&gt; <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">bar</span>(y)</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>There are two branching instructions here and, by pulling them up, it becomes apparent that it is</span>
<span>the exact same condition, triplicated (the third time reified as a data structure):</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">main</span>() {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> condition {</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">foo</span>(x)</span>
<span class="line">  } <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">bar</span>(y)</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

    <a href="#Push-Fors-Down"><span>Push Fors Down</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>This comes from data oriented school of thought. Few things are few, many things are many. Programs</span>
<span>usually operate with bunches of objects. Or at least the hot path usually involves handling many</span>
<span>entities. It is the volume of entities that makes the path hot in the first place. So it often is</span>
<span>prudent to introduce a concept of a </span>&ldquo;<span>batch</span>&rdquo;<span> of objects, and make operations on batches the base</span>
<span>case, with a scalar version being a special case of a batched ones:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-comment">// GOOD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">frobnicate_batch</span>(walruses)</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-comment">// BAD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">for</span> <span class="hl-variable">walrus</span> <span class="hl-keyword">in</span> walruses {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">frobnicate</span>(walrus)</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The primary benefit here is performance. Plenty of performance, </span><a href="http://venge.net/graydon/talks/VectorizedInterpretersTalk-2023-05-12.pdf"><span>in extreme</span>
<span>cases</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a whole batch of things to work with, you can amortize startup cost and be flexible</span>
<span>about the order you process things. In fact, you don</span>&rsquo;<span>t even need to process entities in any</span>
<span>particular order, you can do vectorized/struct-of-array tricks to process one field of all entities</span>
<span>first, before continuing with other fields.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most fun example here is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen_algorithm"><span>FFT-based polynomial</span>
<span>multiplication</span></a><span>: turns out,</span>
<span>evaluating a polynomial at a bunch of points simultaneously could be done faster than a bunch of</span>
<span>individual point evaluations!</span></p>
<p><span>The two pieces of advice about </span><code>for</code><span>s and </span><code>if</code><span>s even compose!</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-comment">// GOOD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">if</span> condition {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">for</span> <span class="hl-variable">walrus</span> <span class="hl-keyword">in</span> walruses {</span>
<span class="line">    walrus.<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">frobnicate</span>()</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">} <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">for</span> <span class="hl-variable">walrus</span> <span class="hl-keyword">in</span> walruses {</span>
<span class="line">    walrus.<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">transmogrify</span>()</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-comment">// BAD</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">for</span> <span class="hl-variable">walrus</span> <span class="hl-keyword">in</span> walruses {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> condition {</span>
<span class="line">    walrus.<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">frobnicate</span>()</span>
<span class="line">  } <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line">    walrus.<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">transmogrify</span>()</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The </span><code>GOOD</code><span> version is good, because it avoids repeatedly re-evaluating </span><code>condition</code><span>, removes a branch</span>
<span>from the hot loop, and potentially unlocks vectorization. This pattern works on a micro level and on</span>
<span>a macro level </span>&mdash;<span> the good version is the architecture of TigerBeetle, where in the data plane we</span>
<span>operate on batches of objects at the same time, to amortize the cost of decision making in the</span>
<span>control plane.</span></p>
<p><span>While performance is perhaps the primary motivation for the </span><code>for</code><span> advice, sometimes it helps with</span>
<span>expressiveness as well. </span><code>jQuery</code><span> was quite successful back in the day, and it operates on</span>
<span>collections of elements. The language of abstract vector spaces is often a better tool for thought</span>
<span>than bunches of coordinate-wise equations.</span></p>
<p><span>To sum up, push the </span><code>if</code><span>s up and the </span><code>for</code><span>s down!</span></p>

    </h1>
<p><span>Wherein I describe the setup of this blog. The main take away from the post are not specific</span>
<span>technical tools, but the underlying principles and ideas, which I wish I had articulated earlier.</span></p>

<figure class="blockquote">
<blockquote><p><span>If you don’t understand the data you don’t understand the problem.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<figcaption><cite><a href="https://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc?si=2IzGZSFKsi1xkls8&amp;t=780"><span>Sun Tzu</span></a></cite></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Physically, a typical blog is a directory of </span><code>.html</code><span> and </span><code>.css</code><span> files which are available over HTTP.</span>
<span>The simplest way to create those files is to just write them by hand. While in some cases that might</span>
<span>be enough, often it isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t.</span></p>
<p><span>If a blog has multiple pages, you usually want to have some common elements </span>&mdash;<span> header, footer,</span>
<span>style, etc. It </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> possible to get common style by copy-pasting an existing page every time you</span>
<span>need to add something. This makes changes hard </span>&mdash;<span> having consistent layout at a single point in time</span>
<span>is not sufficient, one almost always wants to be able to apply consistent modifications as well.</span></p>
<p><span>The second issue with hand-written html is that some parts might be very annoying to hand-write. For</span>
<span>example, code snippets with syntax highlighting require quite a few tags.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, writing html by hand is not necessarily most convenient. A </span><code>*</code><span> bullet-list certainly is more</span>
<span>pleasant to look at than an </span><code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code><span>!</span></p>
<p><span>That</span>&rsquo;<span>s why a blog usually is some sort of a script (a program) which reads input content in some</span>
<span>light markup language (Markdown typically) and writes HTML. As most blogs are similar, it is</span>
<span>possible to generalize and abstract such a script, and the result would be called a </span>&ldquo;<span>static site</span>
<span>generator</span>&rdquo;<span>. I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t like this term very much, as it sounds more complicated than the underlying</span>
<span>problem at hand </span>&mdash;<span> reading </span><code>.md</code><span> files and writing out </span><code>.html</code><span>s.</span></p>
<p><span>Static Site Generators are an example of the </span><dfn><span>template method</span></dfn><span> pattern, where the framework</span>
<span>provides the overall control flow, but also includes copious extension points for customizing</span>
<span>behaviors. Template method allows for some code re-use at the cost of obscure and indirect control</span>
<span>flow. This pattern pays off when you have many different invocations of template method with few, if</span>
<span>any, non-trivial customizations. Conversely, a template method with a single, highly customized</span>
<span>call-site probably should be refactored away in favor of direct control flow.</span></p>
<p><span>If you maintain dozens mostly identical websites, you definitely need a static site generator. If</span>
<span>you have only one site to maintain, you might consider writing the overall scaffolding yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>If you pick an SSG, pay close attention to its extensibility mechanism, you want to avoid situations</span>
<span>where you know how to do something </span>&ldquo;<span>by hand</span>&rdquo;<span>, but the SSG is not flexible enough to express that.</span>
<span>Flexible SSG typically have some way to inject user code in their processing, for free-form</span>
<span>customization. For this reason, I am somewhat skeptical of static site generators implemented in</span>
<span>languages without eval, such as Go and Rust. They might be excellent as long as they fulfill your</span>
<span>needs exactly. However, should you need something more custom than what</span>&rsquo;<span>s available out of the box,</span>
<span>you might find yourself unable to implement that. This creates discontinuity in complexity.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that I am </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> saying that every site out there needs some custom plugins. Most (certainly,</span>
<span>most well-maintained ones) work just fine with fairly vanilla configurations. Rather, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s a</span>
<span>statement about risks </span>&mdash;<span> there</span>&rsquo;<span>s small, but non-zero probability that you</span>&rsquo;<span>ll need something quite</span>
<span>unusual. However, should you find yourself with a use-case which is not supported by your SSG</span>&rsquo;<span>s</span>
<span>available customization options, the cost of the work-around could be very high.</span></p>
<p><span>I only have to maintain this single blog, and I want the freedom to experiment with fairly custom</span>
<span>things, so, in this context, writing the scaffolding script myself makes more sense.</span></p>
<section id="The-Best-Tool-For-The-Job">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Best-Tool-For-The-Job"><span>The Best Tool For The Job</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Converting from one text format to another isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t particularly resource intensive and is trivial to</span>
<span>parallelize. But it requires a fair amount of work with strings, dates, file-system and such, which</span>
<span>points towards a higher-level programming language. However, the overriding concern is stability </span>&mdash;
<span>blogs usually don</span>&rsquo;<span>t enjoy active daily maintenance, and nothing can distract more than the need to</span>
<span>sort out the tooling even before you get to writing.</span></p>
<p><span>I wish I could recommend a stable high-level scripting language, but, to my knowledge, there isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t</span>
<span>any yet. Python falls apart as soon as you need to install a dependency. While I highly recommend</span>
<a href="https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2022/may/13/boring-python-dependencies/"><em><span>Boring Dependency Management</span></em></a><span>,</span>
<span>knowing that </span><code>pip-compile</code><span> is that one extra tool you need is one extra tool too many. While Node</span>
<span>works for adding dependencies, it makes it hard to keep up with them (in Node.JS, dependencies</span>
<span>manage you). I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t know a lot about Ruby, but, in the Jekyll days of this blog, I</span>&rsquo;<span>ve never learned</span>
<span>how to configure </span><code>bundler</code><span> (or is it </span><code>gem</code><span>?) to use project-local dependencies by default.</span></p>
<p><span>For this reason, I</span>&rsquo;<span>d say picking Go or Rust for the task makes sense. Yes, those are quite a bit</span>
<span>more verbose than what you</span>&rsquo;<span>d ideally need for bossing Markdown around, but their quality of</span>
<span>implementation is great, and QoI is what matters here most.</span></p>
<p><span>I use </span><a href="https://deno.land"><span>Deno</span></a><span> for this blog. Deno is poised to become that scripting environment I</span>
<span>wish existed: </span><a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/02/12/a-love-letter-to-deno.html" class="display url">https://matklad.github.io/2023/02/12/a-love-letter-to-deno.html</a></p>
<p><span>In addition to the overall QoI, it has particular affinity for web stuff. Out of the box, it has</span>
<span>extra niceties, like file system watching and hot-reloading, or the permissions system to catch</span>
<span>mistakes when reading or writing wrong files. The only reason to recommend Rust and Go over Deno at</span>
<span>this point is that Deno is still pretty young, and, subjectively, needs more time to graduate into</span>
<span>boring tech.</span></p>
<p><span>Having picked the language, which text format should be the input?</span></p>

<p><span>The most typical choice here is Markdown. Markdown is </span>&hellip;<span> fine overall, but it does have one pretty</span>
<span>glaring deficiency </span>&mdash;<span> vanilla Markdown doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t allow for custom elements. An example of a custom</span>
<span>element would be a shortcut, like </span><kbd><kbd><span>ctrl </kbd>+<kbd> c</span></kbd></kbd><span>. In stock Markdown, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no syntactic</span>
<span>mechanism to designate something as </span>&ldquo;<span>this is my custom element</span>&rdquo;<span>. You can add syntactic extensions,</span>
<span>but then you</span>&rsquo;<span>ll need new syntax for each custom element. Alternatively, you can use a Markdown</span>
<span>dialect which supports generic extensibility, like </span><a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-fenced_divs"><span>Pandoc</span>
<span>Markdown</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://mdxjs.com"><span>MDX</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>An interesting choice for source data format would be HTML with custom tags. If you write some HTML</span>
<span>by hand, that doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t mean you have to write all HTML manually </span>&mdash;<span> a script can desugar hand-written</span>
<span>HTML into more verbose form for the browser. For example, the source for a post can contain a</span>
<span>snippet like this:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;<span class="hl-name">listing</span> <span class="hl-attr">lang</span>=<span class="hl-string">&quot;rust&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span>
<span class="line">fn main() {</span>
<span class="line">    println!(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;/<span class="hl-name">listing</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The script then reads and parses this HTML, and produces appropriate </span><code>pre &gt; code</code><span> with syntax</span>
<span>highlighting soup.</span></p>
<p><span>HTML would  be my recommendation if I were optimizing for stability. These days, many editors have</span>
<a href="https://emmet.io"><span>emmet</span></a><span> out of the box, which makes producing HTML not that horrible:</span></p>

<figure>

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/281008432-9c84db2c-66ca-4c77-9551-b1584d40284d.webm" autoplay muted=true loop=true></video>
</figure>
<p><span>But wouldn</span>&rsquo;<span>t it be great if there was an extensible light markup language, which combines concise</span>
<span>syntax and tasty sugar of Markdown with extensibility and flexibility of HTML,</span>
<a href="https://matklad.github.io/2022/10/28/elements-of-a-great-markup-language.html"><em><span>The Elements of a Great Markup Language</span></em></a><span>?</span>
<span>It actually sort-of-exists already:</span>
<a href="https://djot.net" class="display url">https://djot.net</a></p>
<p><span>Djot is quite a bit like Deno in that it takes well established good ideas, and just doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t mess up</span>
<span>the implementation. But it is also an emerging technology at this point, not even at 1.0, so use at</span>
<span>your own risk.</span></p>

    <h2>
    <a href="#Data-Out"><span>Data Out</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The output clearly has to be HTML, but there are many ways to manufacture this markup. Producing</span>
<span>HTML is not an entirely solved problem. Usually, some sort of textual templating is used, but that</span>&rsquo;<span>s</span>
<span>a fundamentally wrong approach: </span><a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/stringtemplates" class="display url">https://www.devever.net/~hl/stringtemplates</a></p>
<p><span>For this problem, the shape of data is not that of a string, rather it is a tree.</span></p>
<p><span>Luckily for the blogging domain, the main motivation for proper solution is protection from XSS.</span>
<span>Blogs usually don</span>&rsquo;<span>t include user-submitted content, so one can play fast and loose with escaping.</span>
<span>That is to say, if your language supports </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"><span>string</span>
<span>interpolation</span></a><span>,</span>
<span>that might be enough of a templating engine. That is what this blog does </span>&mdash;<span> just backticks in</span>
<span>TypeScript.</span></p>
<p><span>What</span>&rsquo;<span>s tantalizing is that the proper solutions is clearly visible, and is </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> out of reach. We</span>
<span>have JSX now, the proper </span>&ldquo;<span>write code to produce trees</span>&rdquo;<span> solution. Sadly, I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t think it</span>&rsquo;<span>s</span>
<span>immediately usable as of yet. </span><a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/jsx_dom/jsx#jsx-import-source"><span>Deno</span>
<span>docs</span></a><span> mention some</span>
&ldquo;<span>new</span>&rdquo;<span> JSX API, with an initial support. I also don</span>&rsquo;<span>t see some built-in (or obviously blessed) way to</span>
<span>take my JSX syntax and convert it to string when writing to an </span><code>.html</code><span> file.</span></p>

<section id="Look-and-Feel">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Look-and-Feel"><span>Look and Feel</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s not enough to produce HTML, it also has to look good. I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t find this acceptable:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/" class="display url">https://danluu.com/input-lag/</a></p>
<p><span>It is completely unreadable on a 16:9 screen. Which might have good second-order effects (people</span>
<span>clearly come for content rather than for style), but, really, just no :-)</span></p>
<p><span>It would be fair to say that that</span>&rsquo;<span>s browser</span>&rsquo;<span>s (aka backwards compatibility) fault </span>&mdash;<span> ideally,</span>
<span>unstyled HTML would look good, with some reasonable max-width and default body font-size a touch</span>
<span>larger than 16px. I</span>&rsquo;<span>d love if there were some sort of </span><code>&lt;style modern/&gt;</code><span> tag to opt-into a new set of</span>
<span>default css rules, which would be consistent across browsers (obviating the need for CSS reset), and</span>
<span>would make classless HTML readable. Alas, we don</span>&rsquo;<span>t have that, and need to provide browsers with some</span>
<span>minimum amount of CSS ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span>The good news is, that</span>&rsquo;<span>s not so hard this days. When I was starting with programming, web dev was</span>
<span>pretty arcane, and consisted </span><em><span>mostly</span></em><span> of clever hacks, like tables &amp; floats. At that time, I didn</span>&rsquo;<span>t</span>
<span>feel qualified to do CSS.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, the specifications evolved to become much simpler to use (if sprawling at the edges), and</span>
<span>browsers are significantly more uniform, so even I can cook up something presentable. Some survival</span>
<span>tips here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>At small scale, built-in web technologies work. HTML&amp;CSS are plenty; you could use, but you don</span>&rsquo;<span>t</span>
<span>necessary need React, css processors, transpilers, and the rest.</span>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"><span>MDN docs</span></a><span> are awesome.</span>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing#border-box"><code>box-sizing: border-box</code></a>
<span>and understanding </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Mastering_margin_collapsing"><span>margin</span>
<span>collapsing</span></a>
<span>are two required things to make sense of layout in the small.</span>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox"><span>Flexbox</span></a><span> is the modern,</span>
<span>intuitive way for layout in the large.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>CSS reset/normalization is sadly still a thing. Browsers come with default CSS rules for various</span>
<span>elements, and sometimes these rules differ between them, which requires an explicit override in</span>
<span>the css you write. Unfortunately, I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t know much beyond that, but</span>
<a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize" class="url">https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize</a><span> looks like a reasonable place to start.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><span>To conclude, let</span>&rsquo;<span>s circle back to that claim that a typical blog is a directory with a bunch of</span>
<span>.html and .css files. This is not true. There</span>&rsquo;<span>s no physical relation between HTTP requests and</span>
<span>responses, and the contents of the file system. Rather, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s just a thin waist, a convention</span>
<span>collectively employed by many different HTTP servers to allow easy customization of HTTP responses,</span>
<span>yet another template method pattern. This is a remarkably successful thin waist though, it merges</span>
<span>completely with the background and is invisible unless you really go looking for it.</span></p>

    </h1>
<p><span>Which is better for code reviews, a unified diff or a split diff?</span></p>
<p><span>A split diff looks like this for me:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481233-026508cf-47ed-4897-934a-fee18b708553.png">
</figure>
<p><span>And this is a unified one:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277481510-12ee62af-0305-412b-9f37-57a37744751b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>If the changes are simple and small, both views are good. But for larger, more complex changes</span>
<span>neither works for me.</span></p>
<p><span>For a large change, I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t want to do a </span>&ldquo;<span>diff review</span>&rdquo;<span>, I want to do a proper code review of a</span>
<span>codebase at a particular instant in time, paying specific attention to the recently changed areas,</span>
<span>but mostly just doing general review, as if I am writing the code. I need to run tests, use goto</span>
<span>definition and other editor navigation features, apply local changes to check if some things could</span>
<span>have been written differently, look at the wider context to notice things that </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> have been</span>
<span>changed, and in general notice anything that might be not quite right with the codebase,</span>
<span>irrespective of the historical path to the current state of the code.</span></p>
<p><span>So, for me, the ideal diff view would look rather like this:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/277485436-5e9ff9d5-325b-4e2c-8285-4acb6a8c088b.png">
</figure>
<p><span>On the left, the current state of the code (which is also the on-disk state), with changes subtly</span>
<span>highlighted in the margins. On the right, the unified diff for the portion of the codebase currently</span>
<span>visible on the left.</span></p>
<p><span>Sadly, this format of review isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t well supported by the tools </span>&mdash;<span> everyone seems to be happy</span>
<span>reviewing diffs, rather than the actual code?</span></p>
<p><span>I have a low-tech and pretty inefficient workflow for this style of review. A </span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/master/xtool/src/gpr.rs"><code>gpr</code>
<span>script</span></a><span> for checking out a pull</span>
<span>request locally:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-title function_">$</span> gpr 1234 --review</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Internally, it does roughly</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-title function_">$</span> git fetch upstream refs/pull/1234/head</span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-title function_">$</span> git switch --detach FETCH_HEAD</span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-title function_">$</span> git reset $(git merge-base HEAD main)</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The last line is the key </span>&mdash;<span> it erases all the commits from the pull request, but keeps all of the</span>
<span>changes. This lets me abuse my workflow for staging&amp;committing to do a code review </span>&mdash;
<a href="https://github.com/kahole/edamagit"><span>edamagit</span></a><span> shows the list of changed files, I get </span>&ldquo;<span>go to</span>
<span>next/previous change</span>&rdquo;<span> shortcuts in the editor, I can even use the staging area to mark hunks I have</span>
<span>reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>The only thing I </span><em><span>don</span>&rsquo;<span>t</span></em><span> get is automatic synchronization between magit status buffer, and the file</span>
<span>that</span>&rsquo;<span>s currently open in the editor. That is, to view the current file and the diff on the side, I</span>
<span>have to manually open the diff and scroll it to the point I am currently looking at.</span></p>
<p><span>I wish it was easier to get this close to the code without building custom ad-hoc tools!</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. This post talks about how to review code, but reviewing the code is not necessary the primary</span>
<span>goal of code review. See this related post:</span>

    </h1>
<p><span>My thoughts on the topic of whether maintainers owe you anything. Speaking as an author, a maintainer,</span>
<span>a user of, and a contributor to open-source software.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s start with a thing which I find obvious and non-negotiable: I can</span>&rsquo;<span>t lie in my README.md.</span></p>
<p><span>I can</span>&rsquo;<span>t write </span>&ldquo;<span>this software is reliable, fast, and secure</span>&rdquo;<span> if in fact my software is slow,</span>
<span>crashes, and comes with a backdoor pre-installed. More generally, if I promise something in the</span>
<span>readme, I</span>&rsquo;<span>d better follow up on the promise and be ready to apologize if I fail.</span></p>
<p><span>If I create expectations between me and my users, I am on the hook for conforming to them.</span></p>
<p><span>The subtle point here is, if I make an Open Source Project, push it to some forge, write a nice</span>
<span>readme explaining why one would want to use it, provide one-liner for installation, and publish</span>
<span>builds to some package registries, I am already creating some expectations. The act of inviting</span>
<span>users (and writing usage instructions aimed at a general audience </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> an act of inviting users)</span>
<span>forms an agreement between me as a maintainer and the user.</span></p>
<p><span>Expectations, but how great? Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s say that tomorrow at this place I am run over by an automobile.</span>
<span>That would be a tragedy for many reasons! But should I worry, on top of all that, that I can no</span>
<span>longer swiftly react to vulnerabilities reported against my open-source software? Obviously not! And</span>
<span>that</span>&rsquo;<span>s the bound on expectations here: it is absolutely ok for a maintainer to do absolutely</span>
<span>nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, if I publish a project, write a nice readme, provide installation instructions,</span>
<span>etc, and then add a backdoor to my software, I am wrong. Yes, I didn</span>&rsquo;<span>t explicitly mention in the</span>
<span>readme that I am not going to add a backdoor. Still, there is a basic, implicit expectation about</span>
<span>software security, and it is wrong for me to violate it without an explicit mention.</span></p>
<p><span>So I think the default expectations for a published open-source project boil down to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>As a maintainer, I can do absolutely nothing, and that</span>&rsquo;<span>s OK.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>At the same time, I can not be actively hostile to my users.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>I can spell out any extra carve-outs in either direction in my README.md.</span>
<span>E.g., if I promise that releases follow SemVer, I should try to make it so! Conversely, if I am</span>
<span>implementing my own crypto for fun for credentials-handling software, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s ok for me to just</span>
<span>prominently mention that in the documentation.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>What about the license? Doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t it say that THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED </span>&ldquo;<span>AS IS</span>&rdquo;<span>, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF</span>
<span>ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED?</span></p>
<p><span>It does, but that</span>&rsquo;<span>s a statement about legality, not ethicality. If my readme says that my software</span>
<span>is fit for a particular purpose, while it actually (and subtly) isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t in a big way, my users have</span>
<span>the moral right to be mad at me. They don</span>&rsquo;<span>t have the legal right to sue me though.</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you, as an open-source maintainer, publish your software and gain users, you should ask</span>
<span>yourself: </span>&ldquo;<span>do I actually want to have users?</span>&rdquo;<span>. It is totally fine if the answer is </span>&ldquo;<span>no</span>&rdquo;<span>! It is a</span>
<span>safe default answer and what governs most of the git repositories out there.</span></p>
<p><span>Never the less, if the answer to question of users is </span>&ldquo;<span>no</span>&rdquo;<span>, you should make it clear in your Readme</span>
<span>that it is a hobby, non-production-ready project which isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t intended to be used by anyone but you.</span>
<span>Usually, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s enough to just not have a readme at all, or have a very short readme which makes it</span>
<span>obvious that the project isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t supported.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you do have a nice README with installation instructions and such, that constitutes a</span>
&ldquo;<span>yes</span>&rdquo;<span> answer. And then you, as a maintainer, are responsible for a tiny bit of life of your</span>
<span>explicitly invited users. It</span>&rsquo;<span>s not expected that you do much (in fact, doing nothing is totally OK),</span>
<span>but the amount of expectation is greater than zero.</span></p>

<p><span>The  </span><a href="https://matklad.github.io/2022/04/25/why-lsp.html"><em><span>Why LSP</span></em></a><span> post discusses the </span>&ldquo;<span>social</span>
<span>issues</span>&rdquo;<span> solved by LSP. LSP (as a part of overarching Microsoft strategy) is brilliant, because it</span>
<span>moved the world to a new equilibrium where not having basic IDE support is frowned upon. This post</span>
<span>instead discusses architectural aspects of LSP, which I personally find not as brilliant(especially given that</span>
<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/8e6a02d899ef62ef5b8405518b36340e609198e2/pkg/analysis_server/doc/api.html"><span>Dart Analysis Protocol</span></a>
<span>predates LSP and is technically superior in some aspects). Perhaps it</span>
<span>could be useful for someone designing other LSP-shaped protocols! Note that it</span>&rsquo;<span>s been couple of</span>
<span>years since I was actively involved in LSP, probably the grass is greener these days!</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s get to the list of properties, good and bad, in no particular order.</span></p>
<section id="Focus-on-Presentation">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Focus-on-Presentation"><span>Focus on Presentation</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>And let</span>&rsquo;<span>s start with an aspect of the architecture which is genius, and which, I think, is</span>
<span>responsible for a big share of LSP success on the technical side. If you build a tool for working</span>
<span>with </span><em><span>multiple</span></em><span> programming languages, one of the biggest questions is how to find common ground</span>
<span>among different, but ultimately similar, languages. A first attempt is to uncover essential</span>
<span>commonality: after all, all languages have files, variables, functions, classes, right? This is </span>&hellip;
<span>maybe not necessary a dead end, but definitely a thorny and treacherous path </span>&mdash;<span> languages are</span>
<span>different, each language is weird in at least some of its aspects, and common ground risks to level</span>
<span>away meaningful distinctions.</span></p>
<p><span>So, what does LSP do here? It just doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t provide a semantic model of the code base. Instead, it is</span>
<span>focused squarely on the presentation. No matter how different each programming language is, they</span>
<span>all, in the end, use the same completion widget. So LSP is formulated in terms of what</span>&rsquo;<span>s shown in</span>
<span>the completion widget, not in terms of the underlying semantic language entities. That means that</span>
<span>each language has an internal semantic model which is full fidelity </span><em><span>for this particular language</span></em><span>,</span>
<span>and uses it to provide the best completion experience which is possible for a given completion</span>
<span>widget. This is how rust-analyzer is structured internally as well:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Compiler layer deals with the messy language analysis tasks, it derives more structured</span>
<span>information (types) from less structured information (source text), explicitly tracking analysis</span>
<span>layers and phases.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The HIR (high-level intermediate representation) is a façade around the compiler, which provides</span>
<span>a rich graph-based object model of code which looks as if all derived information, like types, is</span>
<span>pre-computed.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The IDE layer uses HIR to compute things like completions, and presents them as Rust-specific,</span>
<span>but semantics-less POD structures to be shown to the user in GUI more or less as is.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>One consequence of this architecture is that LSP requests map to editor widgets, and not to the</span>
<span>underlying language concepts, even when several different widgets are powered by the same underlying</span>
<span>data. For example, LSP has separate requests for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>hierarchical outline of a file displayed in the side bar,</span>
</li>
<li>
&ldquo;<span>breadcrumbs</span>&rdquo;<span> shown in the header,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>syntax-aware selection ranges,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>code folding.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Although all four features are just different views into an AST, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no </span>&ldquo;<span>get AST</span>&rdquo;<span> request in the</span>
<span>LSP. Different requests allow to fine-tune presentation for the  different use-cases, and the</span>
<span>details do differ! Semantic selection might contain some sub-syntax ranges inside string literals</span>
<span>and comments, breadcrumb need to include things like conditionals of </span><code>if</code><span> expressions, while the</span>
<span>outline might want to get rid of less important nodes. Attentive reader will notice that breadcrumbs</span>
<span>and the outline actually use the same LSP request. Even LSP doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t follow LSP philosophy fully!</span></p>

    <a href="#Transport"><span>Transport</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>After a big thing that LSP did right, let</span>&rsquo;<span>s look at a small thing that it got wrong. Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s look at</span>
<span>how information is transmitted over the wire.</span></p>
<p><span>JSON is actually OK! Many people complain that JSON is slow, but that</span>&rsquo;<span>s not actually the case</span>
<span>generally. There are some edge cases, where particular client libraries can be slow as was the case</span>
<span>at least at some point with Swift and Emacs, but JSON is definitely fast enough for Rust, Java and</span>
<span>JavaScript. Of course, something substantially better than JSON is possible in </span><em><span>theory</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>I think ideally we need </span>&ldquo;<span>WebAssembly for IPC</span>&rdquo;<span>, a format that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>has dual text and binary encoding,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>is stupidly simple,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>is thoroughly, readably, and precisely specified,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>and, in general, is principled and a joy to use.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>There</span>&rsquo;<span>s no such format yet, so JSON it is. Good enough.</span></p>
<p><span>HTTP framing is not OK. On the wire, the messages framed like this:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">Content-Length: 92 \r\n</span>
<span class="line">\r\n</span>
<span class="line">Actual message</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>That is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>case-insensitive </span>&ldquo;<span>content-length</span>&rdquo;<span> header,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>followed by length of the following message, formatted as a decimal number in ASCII,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>followed by double </span><code>\r\n</code><span>,</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>followed by the actual message.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>This resembles HTTP, but is not actual HTTP, so you need to write a bit of custom code to deal</span>
<span>with the framing. That</span>&rsquo;<span>s not hard:</span></p>

<p><span>But, still, decoding ASCII message length from variable-length header? That</span>&rsquo;<span>s accidental complexity.</span>
<span>Just separate json objects with newlines instead:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://jsonlines.org" class="url">https://jsonlines.org</a></p>
<p><span>Framing using </span><code>\n</code><span> as a separator is almost certainly available out of the box in the programming</span>
<span>language of choice.</span></p>
<p><span>Wiping away the tears and peeling one more layer from the onion, we see json-rpc:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">

<p><span>But:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Prone to complexity amplification, invites jsonrpc framework with all the latest patterns.</span>
</li>
<li>
<code>"jsonrpc": "2.0"</code><span> is meaningless noise which you have to look at during debugging.</span>

<span>Error codes like </span><code>-32601</code><span> (ah, that comes from xml-rpc!).</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Includes notifications. Notification are a big anti-pattern in RPC, for a somewhat subtle reason.</span>
<span>More on this later.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>What to do instead? Do what Dart does, some excerpts from </span><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/8e6a02d899ef62ef5b8405518b36340e609198e2/pkg/analysis_server/doc/api.html"><span>the specification</span></a><span>:</span></p>

<figure class="blockquote">
<blockquote><p><span>Messages are delineated by newlines. This means,</span>
<span>in particular, that the JSON encoding process must not introduce newlines within a message. Note</span>
<span>however that newlines are used in this document for readability.</span></p>
<p><span>To ease interoperability with Lisp-based clients (which may not be able to easily distinguish</span>
<span>between empty lists, empty maps, and null), client-to-server communication is allowed to replace any</span>
<span>instance of </span>&ldquo;<code>{}</code>&rdquo;<span> or </span>&ldquo;<code>[]</code>&rdquo;<span> with null. The server will always properly represent empty lists as </span>&ldquo;<code>[]</code>&rdquo;
<span>and empty maps as </span>&ldquo;<code>{}</code>&rdquo;<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Clients can make a request of the server and the server will provide a response for each request</span>
<span>that it receives. </span><strong><span>While many of the requests that can be made by a client are informational in</span>
<span>nature, we have chosen to always return a response so that clients can know whether the request was</span>
<span>received and was correct.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Example request:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">request: {</span>
<span class="line">  "id": String</span>
<span class="line">  "method": "server.getVersion"</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">response: {</span>
<span class="line">  "id": String</span>
<span class="line">  "error": optional RequestError</span>
<span class="line">  "result": {</span>
<span class="line">    "version": String</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p><span>That</span>&rsquo;<span>s basically jsonrpc, the good parts, including using </span><code>"UNKNOWN_REQUEST"</code><span> instead of </span><code>-32601</code><span>.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Coordinates">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Coordinates"><span>Coordinates</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>LSP uses </span><code>(line, column)</code><span> pairs for coordinates. The neat thing here is that this solves significant</span>
<span>chunk of </span><code>\n</code><span> vs </span><code>\r\n</code><span> problems </span>&mdash;<span> client and server may represent line endings differently, but</span>
<span>this doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t matter, because coordinates are the same.</span></p>
<p><span>Focus on the presentation provides another motivation, because location information received by the</span>
<span>client can be directly presented to the user, without the need to parse the underlying file. I have</span>
<span>mixed feelings about this.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem, </span><code>column</code><span> is counted using UTF-16 code units. This is, like, </span>&ldquo;<span>no</span>&rdquo;<span>. For many reasons,</span>
<span>but in particular, UTF-16 is definitely the wrong number to show to the user as a </span>&ldquo;<span>column</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>There</span>&rsquo;<span>s no entirely obvious answer what should be used instead. My personal favorite would be</span>
<span>counting utf-8 code units (so, just bytes). You need </span><em><span>some</span></em><span> coordinate space. Any reasonable</span>
<span>coordinate space won</span>&rsquo;<span>t be useful for presentation, so you might as well use the space that matches</span>
<span>the underlying utf-8 encoding, so that accessing substrings is O(1).</span></p>
<p><span>Using unicode codepoints would perhaps be the most agreeable solution. Codepoints are useless </span>&mdash;
<span>you</span>&rsquo;<span>ll need to convert to grapheme clusters for presentation, and to utf-8 code units to do anything</span>
<span>with the string. Still, codepoints are a common denominator, they are more often correct if</span>
<span>incorrectly used for presentation, and they have a nice property that any index less then length is</span>
<span>valid irrespective of the actual string.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Causality-Casualty">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Causality-Casualty"><span>Causality Casualty</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>As mentioned above, one drawback of one-way notifications from jsonrpc is that they don</span>&rsquo;<span>t allow</span>
<span>signaling errors. But there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a more subtle problem here: because you don</span>&rsquo;<span>t receive response to a</span>
<span>notification, it might be hard to order it relative to other events. The Dart protocol is pretty</span>
<span>strict about the ordering of events:</span></p>

<figure class="blockquote">
<blockquote><p><span>There is no guarantee concerning the order in which responses will be returned, but there is a</span>
<span>guarantee that the server will process requests in the order in which they are sent as long as the</span>
<span>transport mechanism also makes this guarantee.</span></p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p><span>This guarantee ensures that the client and the server mutually understand each other</span>&rsquo;<span>s state. For</span>
<span>every request the client knows which file modifications happened before it, and which came afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span>In LSP, when the client wants to modify the state of a file on the server, it sends a notification.</span>
<span>LSP also supports server-initiated edits. Now, if the client sends a </span><code>didChangeTextDocument</code>
<span>notification, and then receives a </span><code>workspace/applyEdit</code><span> request from the server, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no way for</span>
<span>the client to know whether the edit takes the latest change into the account or not. Were</span>
<code>didChangeTextDocument</code><span> a request instead, the client could have looked at the relative order of the</span>
<span>corresponding response and </span><code>workspace/applyEdit</code><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>LSP papers over this fundamental loss of causality by including numeric versions of the documents</span>
<span>with every edit, but this is a best effort solution. Edits might be invalidated by changes to</span>
<span>unrelated documents. For example, for a rename refactor, if a new usage was introduced in a new file</span>
<span>after the refactor was computed, version numbers of the changed files would wrongly tell you that</span>
<span>the edit is still correct, while it will miss this new usage.</span></p>
<p><span>Practically, this is a small problem </span>&mdash;<span> it works most of the  time (I </span><em><span>think</span></em><span> I have seen zero</span>
<span>actual bugs caused by causality loss), and even the proper solution can</span>&rsquo;<span>t order events originating</span>
<span>from the client relative to the events originating from the file system. But the fix is also very</span>
<span>simple </span>&mdash;<span> just don</span>&rsquo;<span>t voluntarily lose causality links!</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Remote-Procedural-State-Synchronization">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Remote-Procedural-State-Synchronization"><span>Remote Procedural State Synchronization</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>And this touches what I think is the biggest architectural issue with LSP. LSP is an RPC protocol</span>
&mdash;<span> it is formed by </span>&ldquo;<span>edge triggered</span>&rdquo;<span> requests that make something happen on the other side. But this</span>
<span>is not how most of IDE features work. What actually is needed is </span>&ldquo;<span>level triggered</span>&rdquo;<span> </span><strong><span>state</span>
<span>synchronization</span></strong><span>. The client and the server need to agree what something </span><em><span>is</span></em><span>, deciding the course</span>
<span>of action is secondary. It is </span>&ldquo;<span>to be or not to be</span>&rdquo;<span> rather than </span>&ldquo;<span>what is to be done</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>At the bottom is synchronization of text documents </span>&mdash;<span> the server and the client need to agree which</span>
<span>files there are, and what is their content.</span></p>
<p><span>Above is synchronization of derived data. For example, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a set of errors in the project. This</span>
<span>set changes when the underlying text files change. Errors change with some lag, as it takes time to</span>
<span>compute them (and sometimes files changes faster than the errors could be re-computed).</span></p>
<p><span>Things like file outline, syntax highlighting, cross-reference information, e.t.c, all follow the</span>
<span>same pattern.</span></p>
<p><span>Crucially, predicting which changes to the source invalidate which derived data requires language</span>
<span>specific knowledge. Changing the text of </span><code>foo.rs</code><span> might affect syntax highlighting in </span><code>bar.rs</code><span> (as</span>
<span>syntax highlighting is affected by types).</span></p>
<p><span>In LSP, highlighting and such are requests. This means that either the client is incorrect and shows</span>
<span>stale highlighting results, or it conservatively re-queries all highlighting results after every</span>
<span>change, wasting the CPU, and </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> showing stale results sometimes, when an update happens outside</span>
<span>of the client (eg, when </span><code>cargo</code><span> finished downloading external crates).</span></p>
<p><span>The Dart model is more flexible, performant and elegant. Instead of highlighting being a request, it</span>
<span>is a </span><em><span>subscription</span></em><span>. The client subscribes to syntax highlighting of particular files, the server</span>
<span>notifies the client whenever highlights for the selected files change. That is, two pieces of state</span>
<span>are synchronized between the client and the server:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>The set of file the client is subscribed to</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The actual state of syntax highlighting for these files.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The former is synchronized by sending the whole </span>&ldquo;<span>current set</span>&rdquo;<span> of files in a request, whenever the</span>
<span>set changes. The latter is synchronized by sending incremental updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Subscriptions are granular both in terms of the file set, as well as in terms of features. The</span>
<span>client might subscribe for errors in the whole project, and for highlights in the currently opened</span>
<span>documents only.</span></p>
<p><span>Subscriptions are implemented in terms of RPC, but they are an overarching organizational pattern</span>
<span>followed by the majority of the requests. LSP doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t have an equivalent, and has real bugs with</span>
<span>outdated information shown to the user.</span></p>
<p><span>I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t think Dart goes as far as possible here. JetBrains Rider, if I understand correctly, does</span>
<span>something smarter:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codemag.com/Article/1811091/Building-a-.NET-IDE-with-JetBrains-Rider" class="url">https://www.codemag.com/Article/1811091/Building-a-.NET-IDE-with-JetBrains-Rider</a></p>
<p><span>I think the idea behind the rider protocol is that you directly define the state you want to</span>
<span>synchronize between the client and the server as state. The protocol then manages </span>&ldquo;<span>magic</span>&rdquo;
<span>synchronization of the state by sending minimal diffs.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Simplistic-Refactorings">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Simplistic-Refactorings"><span>Simplistic Refactorings</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s unwind to something more down to earth, like refactorings. Not the simple ones, like rename,</span>
<span>but complex ones, like </span>&ldquo;<span>change signature</span>&rdquo;<span>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/guide/tips/change-signature/" class="url">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/guide/tips/change-signature/</a></p>
<p><span>In this refactoring, the user selects a function declaration, then rearranges</span>
<span>parameters in some way (reorders, removes, adds, renames, changes types, whatever), and then the IDE</span>
<span>fixes all call-sites.</span></p>
<p><span>The thing that makes this refactor complex is that it is interactive </span>&mdash;<span> it</span>&rsquo;<span>s not an atomic request</span>
&ldquo;<span>rename </span><code>foo</code><span> to </span><code>bar</code>&rdquo;<span>, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s a dialog between the IDE and the user. There are many parameters that</span>
<span>the user tweaks based on the analysis of the original code and the already specified aspects of the</span>
<span>refactoring.</span></p>
<p><span>LSP doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t support this workflows. Dart somewhat supports them, though each refactoring gets to use</span>
<span>custom messages (that is, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s quite good overall protocol for multistep refactorings, but each</span>
<span>refactoring essentially sends </span><code>any</code><span> over the wire, and the IDE on the other side hard-codes specific</span>
<span>GUIs for specific refactorings). This per-refactoring work is not nice, but it is much better than</span>
<span>not having these complex refactorings at all.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Dynamic-Registration">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Dynamic-Registration"><span>Dynamic Registration</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>A small one to conclude. Significant chunk of conceptual LSP complexity comes from support for</span>
<span>dynamic registration of capabilities. I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t understand why that features is there, rust-analyzer</span>
<span>uses dynamic registration only for specifying which files should be watched. And that would be much</span>
<span>simpler if it used a plain request (or a subscription mechanism).</span></p>

<p><span>Two bits of background reading here:</span></p>
<p><span>A famous </span><del><span>novel by Leo Tolstoy</span></del><span> blog post by njs:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/" class="url">https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/</a></p>
<p><span>A less famous, but no less classic, gotchas.md from duct.py:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oconnor663/duct.py/blob/master/gotchas.md#killing-grandchild-processes" class="url">https://github.com/oconnor663/duct.py/blob/master/gotchas.md#killing-grandchild-processes</a></p>
<p><span>It is often desirable to spawn a process, and make sure that, when the parent process exits, the</span>
<span>child process is also killed. This can </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> be achieved using a pattern equivalent to</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">try {</span>
<span class="line">    process = spawn(...)</span>
<span class="line">} finally {</span>
<span class="line">    _ = process.kill()</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The parent process itself might be abruptly killed, and the finally blocks / destructors / atexit</span>
<span>hooks are not run in this case.</span></p>
<p><span>The natural habitat for this pattern are integration tests, where you often spawn external processes</span>
<span>in large amounts, and expect occasional abrupt crashes.</span></p>
<p><span>Sadly, as far as I know, UNIX doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t provide an easy mechanism to bind the lifetimes of two</span>
<span>processes thusly. There</span>&rsquo;<span>s process group mechanism, but it is one-level deep and is mostly reserved</span>
<span>for the shell. There</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span><del><span>docker</span></del><span> cgroups, but that</span>&rsquo;<span>s a Linux-specific mechanism which isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t usually</span>
<span>exposed by cross-platform standard libraries of various languages.</span></p>
<p><span>The trick is using closed stdin as the signal for exit, as that is evenly supported by all platforms,</span>
<span>doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t require much code, and will do nearly the right thing most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span>The drawbacks of this pattern:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s cooperative in the child (you must control the code of the child process to inject the exit</span>
<span>logic)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s somewhat cooperative in the parent: while exiting on standard input EOF will do the right</span>
<span>thing most of the time, there are exceptions. For example, reading from </span><code>/dev/null</code><span> returns 0 (as</span>
<span>opposed to blocking), and daemon processes often have their stdin set to </span><code>/dev/null</code><span>. Sadly,</span>
<span>there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no </span><code class="display">/dev/reads-and-writes-block-forever</code>
</li>
<li>
<span>It is not actually structured. Ideally, parent</span>&rsquo;<span>s exit should block on all descendants exiting, but</span>
<span>that</span>&rsquo;<span>s not the case in this pattern. Still, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s good enough for cleaning up in tests!</span>

    <a href="#What-is-an-Invariant"><span>What is an Invariant?</span> <time datetime="2023-10-06">Oct 6, 2023</time></a>
    </h1>
<p><span>I extolled the benefits of programming with invariants in a couple of recent posts.</span>
<span>Naturally, I didn</span>&rsquo;<span>t explain what I think when I write </span>&ldquo;<span>invariant</span>&rdquo;<span>. This post fixes that.</span></p>
<p><span>There are at least three different concepts I label with </span>&ldquo;<span>invariant</span>&rdquo;<span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>a general </span>&ldquo;<span>math</span>&rdquo;<span> mode of thinking, where you distinguish between fuzzy, imprecise thoughts and</span>
<span>precise statements with logical meaning.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>a specific technique for writing correct code when programming in the small.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>when programming in the large, compact, viral, descriptive properties of the systems.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>I wouldn</span>&rsquo;<span>t discuss the first point here </span>&mdash;<span> I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t know how to describe this better than </span>&ldquo;<span>that</span>
<span>thing that you do when you solve non-trivial math puzzler</span>&rdquo;<span>. The bulk of the post describes the</span>
<span>second bullet point, for which I think I have a perfect litmus test to explain exactly what I am</span>
<span>thinking here. I also touch a bit on the last point in the end.</span></p>
<p><span>So let</span>&rsquo;<span>s start with a </span><a href="https://research.swtch.com/hwmm"><span>litmus test program</span></a><span> to show invariants in</span>
<span>the small in action:</span></p>

<aside class="block">

<p><span>Write a binary search variation which computes insertion point </span>&mdash;<span> the smallest index such that, if</span>
<span>the new element is inserted at this index, the array remains sorted:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">insertion_point</span>(xs: &amp;[<span class="hl-type">i32</span>], x: <span class="hl-type">i32</span>) <span class="hl-punctuation">-&gt;</span> <span class="hl-type">usize</span></span></code></pre>

</figure>

</aside>
  <p><span>You might want to write one yourself before proceeding. Here</span>&rsquo;<span>s an </span><a href="https://matklad.github.io/2021/11/07/generate-all-the-things.html"><span>exhaustive</span>
<span>test</span></a><span> for this functionality,</span>
<span>using </span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/exhaustigen"><span>exhaustigen crate</span></a><span>:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">main</span>() {</span>

<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Here</span>&rsquo;<span>s how I would naively write this function. First, I start with defining the boundaries for the</span>
<span>binary search:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">insertion_point</span>(xs: &amp;[<span class="hl-type">i32</span>], x: <span class="hl-type">i32</span>) <span class="hl-punctuation">-&gt;</span> <span class="hl-type">usize</span> {</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-keyword">let</span> <span class="hl-keyword">mut </span><span class="hl-variable">lo</span> = <span class="hl-number">0</span>;</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-keyword">let</span> <span class="hl-keyword">mut </span><span class="hl-variable">hi</span> = xs.<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">len</span>();</span>
<span class="line">    ...</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Then, repeatedly cut the interval in half until it vanishes</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">    <span class="hl-keyword">while</span> hi &gt; lo {</span>
<span class="line">        <span class="hl-keyword">let</span> <span class="hl-variable">mid</span> = lo + (hi - lo) / <span class="hl-number">2</span>;</span>
<span class="line">        ...</span>
<span class="line">    }</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>and recur into the left or the right half accordingly:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">        <span class="hl-keyword">if</span> x &lt; xs[mid] {</span>
<span class="line">            lo = mid;</span>
<span class="line">        } <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line">            hi = mid;</span>
<span class="line">        }</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Altogether:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hl-title function_">insertion_point</span>(xs: &amp;[<span class="hl-type">i32</span>], x: <span class="hl-type">i32</span>) <span class="hl-punctuation">-&gt;</span> <span class="hl-type">usize</span> {</span>

<span class="line">  <span class="hl-keyword">let</span> <span class="hl-keyword">mut </span><span class="hl-variable">hi</span> = xs.<span class="hl-title function_ invoke__">len</span>();</span>

<span class="line">    }</span>
<span class="line">  }</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">  lo</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>I love this code! It has so many details right!</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>The </span><code>insertion_point</code><span> interface compactly compresses usually messy result of a binary search to</span>
<span>just one index.</span>
</li>
<li>
<code>xs / x</code><span> pair of names for the sequence and its element crisply describes abstract algorithm on</span>
<span>sequencies.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Similarly, </span><code>lo / hi</code><span> name pair is symmetric, expressing the relation between the two indexes.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Half-open intervals are used for indexing.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>There are no special casing anywhere, the natural </span><code>lo &lt; hi</code><span> condition handles empty slice.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>We even dodge Java</span>&rsquo;<span>s binary search bug by computing midpoint without overflow.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>There</span>&rsquo;<span>s only one problem with this code </span>&mdash;<span> it doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t work. Just blindly following rules-of-thumb</span>
<span>gives you working code surprisingly often, but this particular algorithm is an exception.</span></p>
<p><span>The question is, how do we fix this overwise great code? And here</span>&rsquo;<span>s where thinking invariants helps.</span>
<span>Before I internalized invariants, my approach would be to find a failing example, and to fumble with</span>
<span>some plus or minus ones here and there and other special casing to make it work. That is, find a</span>
<span>concrete problem, solve it. This works, but is slow, and doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t allow discovering the problem</span>
<span>before running the code.</span></p>
<p><span>The alternative is to actually make an effort and spell out, explicitly, what the code is supposed</span>
<span>to do. In this case, we want </span><code>lo</code><span> and </span><code>hi</code><span> to bound the result. That is,</span>
<code class="display">lo &lt;= insertion_point &lt;= hi</code>
<span>should hold on every iteration. It clearly holds before we enter the loop. On each iteration, we</span>
<span>would like to shorten this interval, cutting away the part that definitely does not contain</span>
<span>insertion point.</span></p>
<p><span>Elaborating the invariant, all elements to the left of </span><code>lo</code><span> should be less than the target.</span>
<span>Conversely, all elements to the right of </span><code>hi</code><span> should be at least as large as the target.</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">for</span> <span class="hl-variable">i</span> <span class="hl-keyword">in</span> <span class="hl-number">0</span>..lo: xs[i] &lt; x</span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">for</span> <span class="hl-variable">i</span> <span class="hl-keyword">in</span> hi..:  x &lt;= xs[i]</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s now take a second look at the branching condition:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">x &lt; xs[mid]</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>It matches neither invariant prong exactly: </span><code>x</code><span> is on the left, but inequality is strict. We can</span>
<span>rearrange the code to follow the invariant more closely:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">if</span> xs[mid] &lt; x {</span>
<span class="line">    lo = mid + <span class="hl-number">1</span>;</span>
<span class="line">} <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line">    hi = mid;</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<ul>
<li>
<span>we flip the condition and if-branches, so that </span><code>xs[mid] &lt; x</code><span> matches </span><code>xs[i] &lt; x</code><span> from the</span>
<span>invariant for </span><code>lo</code>
</li>
<li>
<span>to make the invariant tight, we add </span><code>mid + 1</code><span> (if </span><code>xs[mid]</code><span> is less than </span><code>x</code><span>, we know that the</span>
<span>insertion point is at least </span><code>mid + 1</code><span>)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The code now works. So what went wrong with the original version with </span><code>x &lt; xs[mid]</code><span>? In the else</span>
<span>case, when </span><code>x &gt;= xs[mid]</code><span> we set </span><code>lo = mid</code><span>, but that</span>&rsquo;<span>s wrong! It might be the case that </span><code>x ==
xs[mid]</code><span> and </span><code>x == xs[mid - 1]</code><span>, which would break the invariant for </span><code>lo</code><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The point isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t in this </span><em><span>particular</span></em><span> invariant or this particular algorithm. It</span>&rsquo;<span>s the general</span>
<span>pattern that  it</span>&rsquo;<span>s easy to write the code which implements the right algorithm, and sort-of works,</span>
<span>but is wrong in details. To get the details right for the right reason, you need to understand</span>
<em><span>precisely</span></em><span> what the result should be, and formulating this as a (loop or recursion) invariant</span>
<span>helps.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Perhaps it</span>&rsquo;<span>s time to answer the title question: invariant is some property which holds at all times</span>
<span>during dynamic evolution of the system. In the above example, the evolution is the program</span>
<span>progressing through subsequent loop iterations. The invariant, the condition binding </span><code>lo</code><span> and </span><code>hi</code><span>,</span>
<span>holds on every iteration. Invariants are powerful, because they are </span><em><span>compressed</span></em><span> descriptions of</span>
<span>the system, they collapse away the time dimension, which is a huge simplification. Reasoning about</span>
<span>each particular path the program could take is hard, because there are so many different paths.</span>
<span>Reasoning about invariants is easy, because they capture properties shared by </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> execution paths.</span></p>
<p><span>The same idea applies when programming in the large. In the small, we looked at how the state of a</span>
<span>running program evolves over time. In the large, we will look at how the source code of the program</span>
<span>itself evolves, as it is being refactored and extended to support new features. Here are some</span>
<span>systems invariants from the systems I</span>&rsquo;<span>ve worked with:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cargo:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>File system paths entered by users are preserved exactly. If the user types</span>
<span class="display"><code>cargo frob ../some/dir</code><span>,</span></span>
<span>Cargo doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t attempt to resolve </span><code>../some/dir</code><span> to an absolute path and passes the path</span>
<span>to the underlying OS as is. The reason for that is that file systems are very finicky. Although it</span>
<span>might look as if two paths are equivalent, there are bound to be cases where they are not. If the</span>
<span>user typed a particular form of a path, they believe that it</span>&rsquo;<span>ll work, and any changes can mess</span>
<span>things up easily.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a relatively compact invariant </span>&mdash;<span> basically, code is just forbidden from calling</span>
<code>fs::canonicalize</code><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>rust-analyzer:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Syntax trees are identity-less value types. That is, if you take an object representing an </span><code>if</code>
<span>expression, that object doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t have any knowledge of where in the larger program the </span><code>if</code>
<span>expression is. The thinking about this invariant was that it simplifies refactors </span>&mdash;<span> while in the</span>
<span>static program it</span>&rsquo;<span>s natural to talk about </span>&ldquo;<code>if</code><span> on the line X in file Y</span>&rdquo;<span>, when you start modifying</span>
<span>code, identity becomes much more fluid.</span></p>
<p><span>This is an invariant with far reaching consequences </span>&mdash;<span> that means that literally everything in</span>
<span>rust-analyzer needs to track identities of things explicitly. You don</span>&rsquo;<span>t just pass around syntax</span>
<span>nodes, you pass nodes with extra breadcrumbs describing their origin. I think this might have been a</span>
<span>mistake </span>&mdash;<span> while it does make refactoring APIs more principled, refactoring is not the common case!</span>
<span>Most of the work of a language server consists of read-only analysis of existing code, and the</span>
<span>actual refactor is just a cherry on top. So perhaps it</span>&rsquo;<span>s better to try to bind identity mode tightly</span>
<span>into the core data structure, and just use fake identities for temporary trees that arise during</span>
<span>refactors.</span></p>
<p><span>A more successful invariant from rust-analyzer is that the IDE has a full, frozen view of a snapshot</span>
<span>of the world. There</span>&rsquo;<span>s no API for inferring the types, rather, the API looks as if all the types are</span>
<span>computed at all times. Similarly, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no explicit API for changing the code or talking about</span>
<span>different historical versions of the code </span>&mdash;<span> the IDE sees a single </span>&ldquo;<span>current</span>&rdquo;<span> snapshot with all</span>
<span>derived data computed. Underneath, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a smart system to secretly compute the information on</span>
<span>demand and re-use previous results, but this is all hidden from the API.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a great, simple mental model, and it provides for a nice boundary between the compiler</span>
<span>proper and IDE fluff like refactors and code completion. Long term, I</span>&rsquo;<span>d love to see several</span>
<span>implementations of the </span>&ldquo;<span>compiler parts</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>TigerBeetle:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A </span><em><span>lot</span></em><span> of thoughtful invariants here! To touch only a few:</span></p>
<p><span>TigerBeetle doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t allocate memory after startup. This simple invariant affects every bit of code</span>
&mdash;<span> whatever you do, you must manage with existing, pre-allocated data structures. You can</span>&rsquo;<span>t just</span>
<code>memcpy</code><span> stuff around, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no ambient available space to </span><code>memcpy</code><span> to! As a consequence (and,</span>
<span>historically, as a motivation for the design)</span>
<a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/cfb46eff4e001bb6b33f5e48924a2de44db20e8f/src/constants.zig#L417-L418"><span>everything</span></a>
<span>has a specific numeric limit.</span></p>
<p><span>Another fun one is that transaction logic can</span>&rsquo;<span>t read from disk. Every object which could be touched</span>
<span>by a transaction needs to be explicitly prefetched into memory before transaction begins. Because</span>
<span>disk IO happens separately from the execution, it is possible to parallelize IO for a whole batch of</span>
<span>transactions. The actual transaction execution is then a very tight serial CPU loop without any</span>
<span>locks.</span></p>
<p><span>Speaking of disk IO, in TigerBeetle </span>&ldquo;<span>reading from disk</span>&rdquo;<span> can</span>&rsquo;<span>t fail. The central API for reading</span>
<span>takes a data block address, a checksum, and invokes the callback with data with a matching checksum.</span>
<span>Everything built on top doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t need to worry about error handling. The way this works internally is</span>
<span>that reads that fail on a local disk are repaired through other replicas in the cluster. It</span>&rsquo;<span>s just</span>
<span>that the repair happens transparently to the caller. If the block of data of interest isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t found on</span>
<span>the set of reachable replicas, the cluster correctly gets stuck until it is found.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Summing up: invariants are helpful for describing systems that evolve over time. There</span>&rsquo;<span>s a</span>
<span>combinatorial explosion of trajectories that a system </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> take. Invariants compactly describe</span>
<span>properties shared by an infinite amount of trajectories.</span></p>
<p><span>In the small, formulating invariants about program state helps to wire correct code.</span></p>
<p><span>In the large, formulating invariants about the code itself helps to go from a small, simple system</span>
<span>that works to a large system which is used in production.</span></p>

    </h1>
<p><span>Most languages provide 6 comparison operators:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">&lt;</span>
<span class="line">&lt;=</span>
<span class="line">&gt;</span>
<span class="line">&gt;=</span>
<span class="line">=</span>
<span class="line">!=</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>That</span>&rsquo;<span>s too damn many of them! Some time ago I</span>&rsquo;<span>ve noticed that my code involving comparisons is often</span>
<span>hard to understand, and hides bugs. I</span>&rsquo;<span>ve figured some rules of thumb to reduce complexity, which I</span>
<span>want to share.</span></p>
<p><span>The core idea is to canonicalize things. Both </span><code>x &lt; y</code><span> and </span><code>y &gt; x</code><span> mean the same, and, if you use</span>
<span>them with roughly equal frequency, you need to spend extra mental capacity to fold the two versions</span>
<span>into the single </span>&ldquo;<span>x tiny, y HUGE</span>&rdquo;<span> concept in your head.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line"><span>number line</span></a><span> is a great intuition and visualization</span>
<span>for comparisons. If you order things from small to big,</span>
<span class="display"><code>A B C D</code><span>,</span></span>
<span>you get intuitive concept of ordering without using comparison operators. You also plug into your</span>
<span>existing intuition that the sort function arranges arrays in the ascending order.</span></p>
<p><span>So, as a first order rule-of-thumb:</span>
<span class="display"><strong><span>Strongly prefer </span><code>&lt;</code><span> and </span><code>&lt;=</code><span> over </span><code>&gt;</code><span> and </span><code>&gt;=</code></strong></span>
<span>And, when using comparisons, use number line intuition.</span></p>
<p><span>Some snippets:</span></p>
<p><span>Checking if a point is inside the interval:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">lo &lt;= x <span class="hl-keyword">and</span> x &lt;= hi</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Checking if a point is outside of the interval:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">x &lt; lo <span class="hl-keyword">or</span> hi &lt; x</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Segment </span><code>a</code><span> is inside segment </span><code>b</code><span>:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">b.start &lt;= a.start <span class="hl-keyword">and</span> a.end &lt;= b.end</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Segments </span><code>a</code><span> and </span><code>b</code><span> are disjoint (either </span><code>a</code><span> is to the left of </span><code>b</code><span> or </span><code>a</code><span> is to the right of </span><code>b</code><span>):</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">a.end &lt; b.start <span class="hl-keyword">or</span> b.end &lt; a.start</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>A particular common case for ordered comparisons is checking that an index is in bounds for an</span>
<span>array. Here, the rule about number line works together with another important rule: </span><span class="display"><strong><span>State</span>
<span>invariants positively</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The indexing invariant is spelled as </span><span class="display"><code>index &lt; xs.len()</code><span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span>and you should prefer to see it exactly that way in the source code. Concretely,</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">if</span> (index &gt;= xs.len) {</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>is hard to get right, because is spells the converse of the invariant, and involves an extra mental</span>
<span>negation (this is subtle </span>&mdash;<span> although there isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t a literal negation operator, you absolutely do</span>
<span>think about this as a negation of the invariant). If possible, the code should be reshaped to</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">if</span> (index &lt; xs.len) {</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">} <span class="hl-keyword">else</span> {</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

    <a href="#TypeScript-is-Surprisingly-OK-for-Compilers"><span>TypeScript is Surprisingly OK for Compilers</span> <time datetime="2023-08-17">Aug 17, 2023</time></a>
    </h1>
<p><span>There are two main historical trends when choosing an implementation language for something</span>
<span>compiler-shaped.</span></p>
<p><span>For more language-centric tasks, like a formal specification, or a toy hobby language, OCaml makes</span>
<span>most sense. See, for example, </span><a href="https://plzoo.andrej.com"><span>plzoo</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/653938a88c6f40eb886d5980ca315136eb861d03/interpreter"><span>WebAssembly reference</span>
<span>interpreter</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For something implementation-centric and production ready, C++ is often chosen: LLVM, clang, v8,</span>
<span>HotSpot are all C++.</span></p>
<p><span>These days, Rust is a great new addition to the landscape. It is influenced most directly by ML and</span>
<span>C++, combines their strengths, and even brings something new of its own to the table, like seamless,</span>
<span>safe multithreading. Still, Rust leans heavily towards production readiness side of the spectrum.</span>
<span>While some aspects of it, like a </span>&ldquo;<span>just works</span>&rdquo;<span> build system, help with prototyping as well, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s</span>
<span>still extra complexity tax due to the necessity to model physical layout of data. The usual advice,</span>
<span>when you start building a compiler in Rust, is to avoid pointers and use indexes. Indexes are great!</span>
<span>In large codebase, they allow greater decoupling (side tables can stay local to relevant modules),</span>
<span>improved performance (an index is  </span><code>u32</code><span> and nudges you towards struct-of-arrays layouts), and more</span>
<span>flexible computation strategies (indexes are easier to serialize or plug into incremental</span>
<span>compilation framework). But they do make programming-in-the-small significantly more annoying, which</span>
<span>is a deal-breaker for hobbyist tinkering.</span></p>
<p><span>But OCaml is crufty! Is there something better? Today, I realized that TypeScript might actually be</span>
<span>OK? It is not really surprising, given how the language works, but it never occured to me to think</span>
<span>about TypeScript as an ML equivalent before.</span></p>
<p><span>So, let</span>&rsquo;<span>s write a tiny-tiny typechecker in TS!</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, we start with </span><a href="https://deno.land"><span>deno</span></a><span>. See </span><a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/02/12/a-love-letter-to-deno.html"><em><span>A Love Letter to</span>
<span>Deno</span></em></a><span> for more details, but the</span>
<span>TL;DR is that deno provides out-of-the-box experience for TypeScript. This is a pain point for</span>
<span>OCaml, and something that Rust does better than either OCaml or C++. But deno does this better than</span>
<span>Rust! It</span>&rsquo;<span>s just a single binary, it comes with linting and formatting, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no compilation step,</span>
<span>and there are built-in task runner and watch mode. A dream setup for quick PLT hacks!</span></p>
<p><span>And then there</span>&rsquo;<span>s TypeScript itself, with its sufficiently flexible, yet light-ceremony type system.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s start with defining an AST. As we are hacking, we won</span>&rsquo;<span>t bother with making it an IDE-friendly</span>
<span>concrete syntax tree, or incremental-friendly </span>&ldquo;<span>only store relative offsets</span>&rdquo;<span> tree, and will just tag</span>
<span>AST nodes with locations in file:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">Location</span> {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">file</span>: <span class="hl-built_in">string</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">line</span>: <span class="hl-built_in">number</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">column</span>: <span class="hl-built_in">number</span>;</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Even here, we already see high-level nature of TypeScript </span>&mdash;<span> string is just a </span><code>string</code><span>, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no</span>
<span>thinking about </span><code>usize</code><span> vs </span><code>u32</code><span> as numbers are just </span><code>number</code><span>s.</span></p>
<p><span>Usually, an expression is defined as a sum-type. As we want to tag each expression with a location,</span>
<span>that representation would be slightly inconvenient for us, so we split things up a bit:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span> {</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-attr">location</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Location</span>;</span>
<span class="line">    <span class="hl-attr">kind</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">ExprKind</span>;</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">type</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprKind</span> = <span class="hl-title class_">ExprBool</span> | <span class="hl-title class_">ExprInt</span> | ... ;</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>One more thing </span>&mdash;<span> as we are going for something quick, we</span>&rsquo;<span>ll be storing inferred types directly in</span>
<span>the AST nodes. Still, we want to keep raw and type-checked AST separate, so what we are going to do</span>
<span>here is to parametrize the </span><code>Expr</code><span> over associated data it stores. A freshly parsed expression would</span>
<span>use </span><code>void</code><span> as data, and the type checker will set it to </span><code>Type</code><span>. Here</span>&rsquo;<span>s what we get:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">location</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Location</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">data</span>: T;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">kind</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">ExprKind</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">type</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprKind</span>&lt;T&gt; =</span>
<span class="line">  | <span class="hl-title class_">ExprBool</span>&lt;T&gt;</span>
<span class="line">  | <span class="hl-title class_">ExprInt</span>&lt;T&gt;</span>
<span class="line">  | <span class="hl-title class_">ExprBinary</span>&lt;T&gt;</span>
<span class="line">  | <span class="hl-title class_">ExprControl</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>A definition of </span><code>ExprBinary</code><span> could look like this:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprBinary</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">op</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">BinaryOp</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">lhs</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">rhs</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">}</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">enum</span> <span class="hl-title class_">BinaryOp</span> {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-title class_">Add</span>, <span class="hl-title class_">Sub</span>, <span class="hl-title class_">Mul</span>, <span class="hl-title class_">Div</span>,</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-title class_">Eq</span>, <span class="hl-title class_">Neq</span>,</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-title class_">Lt</span>, <span class="hl-title class_">Gt</span>, <span class="hl-title class_">Le</span>, <span class="hl-title class_">Ge</span>,</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Note how I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t introduce separate types for, e.g, </span><code>AddExpr</code><span> and </span><code>SubExpr</code><span> </span>&mdash;<span> all binary</span>
<span>expressions have the same shape, so one type is enough!</span></p>
<p><span>But we need a tiny adjustment here. Our </span><code>Expr</code><span> kind is defined as a union type. To match a value of</span>
<span>a union type a bit of runtime type information is needed. However, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s one of the core properties</span>
<span>of TypeScript that it doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t add any runtime behaviors. So, if we want to match on expression kinds</span>
<span>(and we for sure want!), we need to give a helping hand to the compiler and include a bit of RTTI</span>
<span>manually. That would be the </span><code>tag</code><span> field:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprBinary</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span class="line hl-line">  <span class="hl-attr">tag</span>: <span class="hl-string">&quot;binary&quot;</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">op</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">BinaryOp</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">lhs</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">rhs</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><code>tag: "binary"</code><span> means that the only possible runtime value for </span><code>tag</code><span> is the string </span><code>"binary"</code><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly to various binary expressions, boolean literal and int literal expressions have </span><em><span>almost</span></em>
<span>identical shape.  Almost, because the payload (</span><code>boolean</code><span> or </span><code>number</code><span>) is different. TypeScript</span>
<span>allows us to neatly abstract this over:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">type</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprBool</span>&lt;T&gt; = <span class="hl-title class_">ExprLiteral</span>&lt;T, <span class="hl-built_in">boolean</span>, <span class="hl-string">&quot;bool&quot;</span>&gt;;</span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">type</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprInt</span>&lt;T&gt; = <span class="hl-title class_">ExprLiteral</span>&lt;T, <span class="hl-built_in">number</span>, <span class="hl-string">&quot;int&quot;</span>&gt;;</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprLiteral</span>&lt;T, V, <span class="hl-title class_">Tag</span>&gt; {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">tag</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Tag</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">value</span>: V;</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Finally, for control-flow expressions we only add </span><code>if</code><span> for now:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">type</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprControl</span>&lt;T&gt; = <span class="hl-title class_">ExprIf</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">export</span> <span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">ExprIf</span>&lt;T&gt; {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">tag</span>: <span class="hl-string">&quot;if&quot;</span>;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">cond</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">then_branch</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">else_branch</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;T&gt;;</span>
<span class="line">}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>This concludes the definition of the ast! Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s move on to the type inference! Start with types:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">type</span> <span class="hl-title class_">Type</span> = <span class="hl-title class_">TypeBool</span> | <span class="hl-title class_">TypeInt</span>;</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">TypeBool</span> {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">tag</span>: <span class="hl-string">&quot;Bool&quot;</span>;</span>
<span class="line">}</span>

<p><span>Our types are really simple, we could have gone with </span><span class="display"><code>type Type = "Int" | "Bool"</code><span>,</span></span><span> but</span>
<span>lets do this a bit more enterprisy! We define separate types for integer and boolean types. As these</span>
<span>types are singletons, we also provide canonical definitions. And here is another TypeScript-ism.</span>
<span>Because TypeScript fully erases types, everything related to types lives in a separate namespace. So</span>
<span>you can have a type and a value sharing the same name. Which is exactly what we use to define the</span>
<span>singletons!</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we can take advantage of our associated-data parametrized expression and write the</span>
<span>signature of</span></p>

<p><span>Before we go further, let</span>&rsquo;<span>s generalize this visiting pattern a bit! Recall that our expressions are</span>
<span>parametrized by the type of associated data, and type-checker-shaped transformations are essentially an</span>
<code class="display">Expr&lt;U&gt; -&gt; Expr&lt;V&gt;</code>
<span>transformation.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s make this generic!</span></p>

<p><span>Transform maps an expression carrying </span><code>T</code><span> into an expression carrying </span><code>V</code><span> by applying an </span><code>f</code>

<span>counter-intuitive, but correct </span>&mdash;<span> we run transformation bottom up, transforming the leaves first.</span>
<span>So, when the time comes to visit an interior node, all subexpression will have been transformed!</span></p>

<p><span>Note how here </span><code>expr.kind</code><span> is both </span><code>Expr&lt;U&gt;</code><span> and  </span><code>Expr&lt;V&gt;</code><span> </span>&mdash;<span> literals don</span>&rsquo;<span>t depend on this type</span>

<p><span>Astute reader will notice that our visitor functions now take an extra </span><code>ast.Location</code><span> argument.</span>
<span>TypeScript allows using this argument only in cases where it is needed, cutting down verbosity.</span></p>
<p><span>And that</span>&rsquo;<span>s all for today! The end result is pretty neat and concise. It took some typing to get there,</span>
<span>but TypeScript autocompletion really helps with that! What</span>&rsquo;<span>s more important, there was very little</span>
<span>fighting with the language, and the result feels quite natural and directly corresponds to the shape</span>
<span>of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I am not entirely sure in the conclusion just yet, but I think I</span>&rsquo;<span>ll be using TypeScript as my tool</span>
<span>of choice for various small language hacks. It is surprisingly productive due to the confluence of</span>
<span>three aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>deno is a perfect scripting runtime! Small, hermetic, powerful, and optimized for effective</span>
<span>development workflows.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>TypeScript tooling is great </span>&mdash;<span> the IDE is helpful and productive (and deno makes sure that it</span>
<span>also requires zero configuration)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The language is powerful both at runtime and at compile time. You can get pretty fancy with types,</span>
<span>but you can also just escape to dynamic world if you need some very high-order code.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><span>Just kidding, here</span>&rsquo;<span>s one more cute thing. Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s say that we want to have lots of syntactic sugar,</span>
<span>and also want type-safe desugaring. We could tweak our setup a bit for that: instead of </span><code>Expr</code><span> and</span>
<code>ExprKind</code><span> being parametrized over associated data, we circularly parametrize </span><code>Expr</code><span> by the whole</span>
<code>ExprKind</code><span> and  vice verse:</span></p>

<pre><code><span class="line"><span class="hl-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hl-title class_">Expr</span>&lt;K&gt; {</span>
<span class="line">  <span class="hl-attr">location</span>: <span class="hl-title class_">Location</span>,</span>

<p><span>This allows expressing desugaring in a type-safe manner!</span></p>
